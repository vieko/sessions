# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added

- **Subagent architecture** - Context-efficient operations for heavy commands
  - `codebase-explorer` (haiku) - Fast, isolated codebase research
  - `spec-writer` (inherit) - Synthesizes research + interview into specs
  - `work-reviewer` (sonnet) - Strategic review with categorized findings
  - Subagents ship with plugin in `agents/` directory

### Changed

- **`/sessions:spec`** - Now uses subagents for research and writing phases
  - Research runs in isolated context, returns structured summary
  - Interview stays in main context with clean state
  - Spec writing runs in isolated context
  - Result: ~70% less main context consumption

- **`/sessions:document`** - Now uses codebase-explorer subagent
  - Exploration runs in isolated context
  - Only findings summary returns to main context

- **`/sessions:review`** - Now uses work-reviewer subagent
  - Analysis runs in isolated context (sonnet for depth)
  - Categorized findings return to main context for action decisions

- **Simplified setup** - Removed model configuration questions
  - Subagent models are fixed in agent definitions (not user-configurable)
  - Setup now asks 4 questions in one round (specs, docs, git, Linear)
  - Config.json no longer includes `models` section

- Removed `Glob` and `Grep` from spec/document/review allowed-tools (subagents handle this)
- Restricted `work-reviewer` Bash access to git commands only (read-only analysis)

### Why This Change

Context burns out quickly during spec/document/review operations, requiring shorter sessions and frequent auto-compacting. Subagents isolate heavy research from the main conversation, preserving context for user interaction.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added

- **Linear MCP integration** - Full issue lifecycle support
  - `/sessions:start` - Fetch Linear issue context with `ENG-123` or Linear URL
  - `/sessions:review` - Create Linear issues from findings
  - `/sessions:archive` - Mark Linear issues as Done when work completes
  - `linearEnabled` config option (opt-in, default false)
  - Graceful degradation when Linear MCP not configured

- **Hybrid spec approach** - Research-informed interviewing for `/sessions:spec`
  - Step 4: Research phase (patterns, constraints, conflicts)
  - Step 5: Interview phase (3 rounds: core → edge cases → scope)
  - Informed questions based on codebase findings, not generic prompts
  - New spec sections: Context, Decisions, Edge Cases, Out of Scope

### Changed

- `/sessions:configure` now asks about Linear integration
- Added `mcp__linear__*` to allowed-tools in start, review, and archive commands
- Documented AskUserQuestion 4-question limit in configure and start commands

### Fixed

- Correct Linear MCP tool names: `linear_search_issues`, `linear_create_issue`, `linear_update_issue`
- Archive command uses correct parameter `id` (not `issueId`)

## [0.5.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added

- **Session scripts management** - Location-based script tracking
  - `.sessions/scripts/` directory for temporary session scripts
  - `/sessions:end` prompts to keep, move to project, or delete scripts
  - Simple workflow replaces complex `@session-script` frontmatter approach

- **Configurable artifact locations**
  - `specsLocation`: Save specs in `.sessions/specs/` or project root `specs/`
  - `docsLocation`: Save docs in `.sessions/docs/` or project root `docs/`
  - Asked during `/sessions:start` setup and changeable via `/sessions:configure`

### Changed

- **Renamed `plans/` to `specs/`** - Clearer distinction from Claude Code's plan mode
  - `/sessions:plan` → `/sessions:spec`
  - `plans/` directory → `specs/`
  - `models.plan` → `models.spec` in config.json

- **Hardened git operations**
  - Commands never use `git add -f` - respects gitignore
  - Checks if files can be staged before committing
  - Clear messaging when files are gitignored

- **Simplified scripts review in `/sessions:review`**
  - Removed `scriptsTracking` config option
  - Removed `@session-script` frontmatter requirement
  - Now just lists scripts in `.sessions/scripts/` that need attention

### Migration from 0.4.x

1. Rename your `plans/` directory to `specs/` (if using hybrid/commit-all git strategy)
2. Update `models.plan` to `models.spec` in `.sessions/config.json`
3. Run `/sessions:configure` to set new location preferences

## [0.4.1] - 2025-12-22

### Fixed

- **`/sessions:configure`** - Now always runs interactively with all 4 questions
- **`/sessions:end`** - Checks git strategy before committing; skips for `ignore-all`
- **`/sessions:git-strategy`** - Now uses `AskUserQuestion` for consistent UX
- **`/sessions:start`** - Aligned question format with configure command
- **`session-context` skill** - Removed references to non-existent `prep/` and `packages/` directories

### Changed

- Removed `scripts/configure.sh` reference from CHANGELOG (was removed in refactor)

## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-22

### Added

- **`/sessions:review`** - Strategic work review command
  - Identifies blindspots, gaps, quick wins
  - Checks best practices and maintainability
  - Categorizes findings by severity and effort
  - Offers to fix, plan, or create issues
  - Optional scripts tracking integration

- **`/sessions:configure`** - Plugin configuration command
  - Global model preferences (plan, document, review)
  - Per-project settings (git strategy, docs location, scripts tracking)

- **Scripts tracking** (opt-in)
  - `@session-script` frontmatter standard for agent-generated scripts
  - Lifecycle management: permanent, temporary, deprecated
  - Expiration dates for temporary scripts
  - `/sessions:review` scans for stale/expired scripts

- **`scripts/configure.sh`** - Updates command frontmatter
  - Validates model values (inherit, haiku, sonnet, opus)
  - Handles add, update, and remove operations

- **CLAUDE.md creation** - Auto-created on `/sessions:start`
  - Points Claude to `.sessions/index.md`
  - Lists available session commands
  - Updates existing CLAUDE.md if missing session reference

- **Per-project config** (`.sessions/config.json`)
  - `docsLocation`: `.sessions/docs/` or `docs/` (root)
  - `scriptsTracking`: enabled/disabled

- **Model specifications**
  - Mechanical commands use `model: haiku` (start, end, archive, configure, git-strategy)
  - Thinking commands inherit conversation model (plan, document, review)

### Changed

- **Simplified directory structure**
  - Removed `prep/` - never used in practice
  - Removed `packages/` - unused even in monorepos
  - Removed `.version` - no migration logic needed
  - Removed `WORKSPACE.md` - unnecessary complexity

- **Naming conventions standardized**
  - Archive: `YYYY-MM-DD-<issue>-<topic>.md`
  - Plans: `<issue>-<topic>.md`
  - Docs: `<topic>.md`

- **Enhanced index.md template**
  - Added Key Resources section (code references, external links)
  - Added Archived Sessions section (links to archives)

- **Plan lifecycle guidance**
  - Plans are temporary artifacts
  - Delete when implemented, move reference content to docs/

- **Archive improvements**
  - Added Impact section to template
  - Step to clean up completed plans
  - Links in Archived Sessions section

- **Hybrid git strategy simplified**
  - Removed WORKSPACE.md and README.md from whitelist

### Fixed

- Archive naming convention now documented in `archive.md`
- Plan naming convention now documented in `plan.md`

### Migration from create-sessions-dir

1. Install the sessions plugin
2. Existing `.sessions/` directories work as-is
3. Remove old `.claude/commands/` (plugin provides them)
4. Remove old `.claude/skills/` (plugin provides them)
5. Run `/sessions:configure` to set model preferences
