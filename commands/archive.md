# Archive Session

## Step 1: Find Git Root

Run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to locate the repository root.

## Step 2: Review Completed Work

Read `<git-root>/.sessions/index.md` and identify completed work:
- Sessions with merged PRs
- Completed features/tasks
- Work that's no longer active

## Step 3: Create Archive Entry

Move completed session content to `<git-root>/.sessions/archive/`.

**Naming convention**: `YYYY-MM-DD-<issue-id>-<topic>.md`

Examples:
- `2025-12-22-GTMENG-387-inbound-improvements.md` (with issue ID)
- `2025-12-22-fix-login-redirect.md` (without issue ID)

Use this template:
```markdown
# [TOPIC]

**Date**: [DATE]
**Issue**: [ISSUE-ID or N/A]
**PR**: [PR link if available]
**Status**: Completed

## Summary

[Brief description of what was accomplished]

## Accomplished

- [List of completed items]

## Decisions Made

- [Key decisions and rationale]

## Impact

- [Before/after metrics if applicable]
- Files changed: [count]

## Related

- [Links to related docs, plans, or code]
```

## Step 4: Clean Up Index

Update `<git-root>/.sessions/index.md`:
- Remove archived session entries from Recent Sessions
- Keep Current State focused on active work
- Update Next Session Priorities
- Add link to archive file in Archived Sessions section:
  ```markdown
  ## Archived Sessions

  - [YYYY-MM-DD - Topic](archive/YYYY-MM-DD-issue-topic.md)
  ```

## Step 5: Clean Up Plans (if applicable)

Check if any plans in `<git-root>/.sessions/plans/` are now complete:
- If the plan was fully implemented, delete the plan file (archive has the record)
- If the plan has reusable reference material, move that content to `docs/` first

## Step 6: Commit Archive

```bash
git add .sessions/
git commit -m "docs: archive completed session work"
```

## Step 7: Confirm

Report:
- What was archived
- Any plans cleaned up
- Current state of index.md
- Ready for next session
