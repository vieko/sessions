# End Session

## Step 1: Find Git Root

Run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to locate the repository root.

## Step 2: Check for Handoff

Check if `<git-root>/.bonfire/handoff/handed-off` exists.

**If it exists**: This session was handed off to a new session. Warn the user:

> "This session was previously handed off. The new session may have already updated `index.md`.
> Running `/bonfire-end` here could cause conflicts or overwrite the new session's changes."

Ask the user:
1. "Proceed anyway" - Continue with /bonfire-end (user takes responsibility)
2. "Skip index.md update" - Only commit changes, don't update context
3. "Cancel" - Abort /bonfire-end

If user chooses to proceed or skip, delete the marker file after completion:
```bash
rm <git-root>/.bonfire/handoff/handed-off
```

**If marker doesn't exist**: Continue normally.

## Step 3: Review Session Work

Review what was accomplished this session by examining:
- Recent git commits
- Files changed
- Conversation context

## Step 4: Update Session Context

Update `<git-root>/.bonfire/index.md`:

1. Update the session entry with:
   - **Accomplished**: List what was completed
   - **Decisions**: Key decisions made and rationale
   - **Files Modified**: Important files changed (if relevant)
   - **Blockers**: Any issues encountered

2. Update "Next Session Priorities" based on remaining work

3. Update "Current State" to reflect new status

## Step 5: Update Codemap

Update the "Codemap" section in `index.md` with files referenced this session:

1. **Identify key files** from this session:
   - Files you read or edited
   - Files mentioned in commits
   - Files central to the work done

2. **Update "This Session's Key Files"**:
   - List up to 10 most relevant files
   - Include brief description of what each does
   - Format: `- \`path/to/file.ts\` - Brief description`

3. **Preserve user-curated sections**:
   - Keep "Entry Points" as-is (user maintains these)
   - Keep "Core Components" as-is (user maintains these)

4. **Keep it concise**:
   - Only include files directly relevant to session work
   - Remove stale entries from previous sessions
   - Max 10 files in "This Session's Key Files"

Example:
```markdown
## Codemap

**Entry Points** (user-curated):
- `src/index.ts` - Main entry

**Core Components** (user-curated):
- `src/commands/` - CLI commands

**This Session's Key Files** (auto-updated):
- `claude/commands/configure.md` - Added PreCompact hook setup
- `claude/commands/end.md` - Added Codemap update step
- `.bonfire/specs/codemap-feature.md` - Feature specification
```

## Step 6: Commit Changes (if tracked)

Read `<git-root>/.bonfire/config.json` to check `gitStrategy`.

**If gitStrategy is "ignore-all"**: Skip committing - nothing is tracked. Tell the user session context was updated locally.

**If gitStrategy is "hybrid" or "commit-all"**:

1. **Check what can be staged**: Run `git status .bonfire/` to see what files are not ignored
2. **NEVER use `git add -f`** - if a file is gitignored, respect that
3. **Stage only unignored files**:
   ```bash
   git add .bonfire/
   ```
4. **Check if anything was staged**: Run `git diff --cached --quiet .bonfire/`
   - If nothing staged (exit code 0), tell user "Session context updated locally (files are gitignored)"
   - If changes staged, commit:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "docs: update session context"
     ```

If the commit fails due to hooks, help resolve the issue (but never bypass hooks with `--no-verify`).

## Step 7: Confirm

Summarize:
- What was documented
- Next priorities
- Any follow-up needed

Let the user know they can run `/bonfire-archive` when this work is merged and complete.
