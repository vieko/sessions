# Bonfire Context

This skill loads project session context from `.bonfire/index.md` to provide continuity across AI coding sessions.

## When to Use This Skill

Load this skill when the user:
- Asks about previous work or decisions
- References "last time", "previously", "before"
- Wants to know about blockers or pending issues
- Asks what the project status is
- Starts a significant task that might have prior context

## Instructions

1. Find the git root: `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`

2. Check if `.bonfire/index.md` exists at the git root

3. If it exists, read it to understand:
   - Current project status and recent work
   - Active decisions and their rationale
   - Known blockers or pending issues
   - Links to relevant specs or documentation

4. Check `.bonfire/specs/` if the user asks about implementation specs

5. Check `.bonfire/docs/` if the user asks about documented topics

## File Structure

```
.bonfire/
├── index.md          # Main session context (read this first)
├── config.json       # Project settings
├── archive/          # Completed work history
├── docs/             # Topic documentation
└── specs/            # Implementation specs
```

## Important

- This skill is for **reading** context, not updating it
- Session updates happen via `/bonfire-end` command
- Don't modify `.bonfire/index.md` unless explicitly asked
- If `.bonfire/` doesn't exist, the project may not use this pattern
